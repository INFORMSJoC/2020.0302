# Data for replication

Here is the data needed for replicating the experiments. 

The city list and link list csv files include data on the Dutch network

The three subfolders correspond to the three sets of instances used. Each folder has two types of .npy (python numpy) files. deptimes_x_y.npy contains the departure times of the x trucks in instance number y. ODdata_x_y.npy contains the origins and destinations of the x trucks in instance number y. The origins and destinations are labelled based on the node id (see city list and link list csv files)
